# Google-Homepage-Redesign
This is a re-creation of the Google homepage using basic HTML and CSS.
I started with the top nav items minus the grid icon and the profile picture, central logo, search and i'm feeling lucky buttons, and the search bar input field.
I still need to complete the footer, add the magnifying glass icon to the search field and add the grid and profile icons to the top nav.
Restructured the top nav items using a list element and display: inline. Need to figure out why profpic isn't last in the order.
